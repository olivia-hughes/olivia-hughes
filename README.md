# Welcome to my profile.

I am a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Essex, eager to join the world of data analysis and software engineering. 
Iâ€™m currently taking the time to transfer my projects from university onto GitHub for the public to see, and for constructive criticism before the academic year starts.

Languages Practiced:
- Python
- Java
- HTML, CSS, PHP
- JavaScript
- C++

## **About me, *outside of coding***

I have a passion for animals, and have helped my family rescue and rehabilitate horses, reptiles, rodents, and other livestock. 
I'm also quite a fast learner, I can play 7 different instruments (my favourites being the guitar, and my hand-painted banjo). 

My favourite game franchises are Halo and the Batman Arkham series (not the recent games...), and I enjoy achievement-hunting on them.
