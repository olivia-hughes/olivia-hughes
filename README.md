# Hi there!

## About me

I am Olivia Hughes, a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Essex, pursuing my Bachelor (with Honours) degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

I enjoy learning about a wide range of topics in this broad subject, and am currently studying data structures and algorithms, application programming, and software engineering- just to name a few. 

Alongside Python and Java, I am learning C++ as a module at my university also. On my profile here, you can see me putting these fundamental ideas learned in my classes into practice :)

Outside of the world of tech, I have a range of hobbies and skills that I put to use- I can play 7 instruments (mostly string!), I love to paint, and I'm trying to get into archery as well. 

I also love videogames, and reading biographies- my favourite game is Batman Arkham City (with the second being Halo Reach), and the book I am currently reading is the Definitive Story of Elliot Smith.
